## 📌 Overview
This is a full-stack **Digital Health Care Management System (DHCMS)** I built using **Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL** to help healthcare providers manage patient records more efficiently. The system is designed to be **role-based**, meaning different users—**doctors, patients, receptionists, and admins**—each have their own dashboard with relevant features.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Patient Management** – Stores patient information, including medical history, diagnoses, and past consultations.

✅ **Appointment Scheduling** – Patients can book appointments based on available slots, while doctors manage their schedules.

✅ **Medical History Tracking** – Displays a timeline of diagnoses and treatments for quick reference.

✅ **Authentication & Security** – Uses **NextAuth** with phone-based login and auto-generated passwords for patients.

🔲 **Billing & Invoicing** – Handles payments and invoices for hospital services.

🔲 **Inventory Management** – Still working on tracking medication and supplies to ensure proper stock levels.

🔲 **Lab Results Integration** – Planning to allow doctors to upload lab test results directly to patient records.

🔲 **Messaging System** – Considering adding a built-in chat for doctors and patients.
